I am currently a MSc Computer Science Student at ETH Zurich, where I focus on machine learning. I recently wrote my Master's Thesis on pruning and generalization in deep neural networks in collaboration with [Prof. Dr. Yarin Gal](https://oatml.cs.ox.ac.uk//members/yarin/) at the University of Oxford and [Prof. Dr. Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea) at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

At ETH and at IBM Research, I undertook [research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10804) on information retrieval and text classification for medical applications.
Recently, I interned at [BCG Gamma](https://www.bcg.com/beyond-consulting/bcg-gamma/default) as a data scientist where I contributed to the development of a text classification algorithm for financial transactions.
Before that, I worked at [QantEv](https://www.qantev.com/), an InsureTech start up which emerged from the [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) programme. There, I designed and implemented optimal transport methods and contributed to the development of a web application.
