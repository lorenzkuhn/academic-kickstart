I am currently a MSc Computer Science Student at ETH Zurich, where I focus on machine learning. At ETH and at IBM Research, I undertook research on information retrieval and text classification for medical applications.
Recently, I interned at BCG Gamma as a data scientist where I contributed to the development of a text classification algorithm for financial transactions.
Before that, I worked at QantEv, an InsureTech start up which emerged from the Entrepreneur First program. There, I designed and implemented optimal transport methods and contributed to the development of a web application.
