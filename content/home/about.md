Hi! I am currently a MSc Computer Science Student at ETH Zurich, where I focus on machine learning. Recently, I interned at IBM Research where I contributed to the research and development of a medical recommendation system based on machine learning. For my undergraduate thesis I developed natural language processing methods to improve the performance of a medical information retrieval system.
